# Java-Battleship

The game, Battleship, written in Java.

## Requirements / Dependencies

* Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
* JUnit 5 (built into Eclipse IDE)
* JDK (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

## Importing Project

1. Make sure you've installed all requirements
2. Clone this repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/mosers1/Java-Battleship.git`
3. Open the Eclipse IDE
4. Import the project
    * File --> Open Projects from File System... --> Select directory --> Click OK

## Running Project & Unit Tests

**Running application**\
With the Eclipse IDE opened and the Battleship project imported, right-click on Battleship.java,
select Run As, then select Java Application. The program will launch in the IDE's Console window.

**Running unit tests (LocationTest.java example)**\
With the Eclipse IDE opened and the Battleship project imported, right-click on LocationTest.java,
select Run As, then select JUnit Test. Test results will be displayed in the IDE's JUnit window.

For this example, LocationTest.java tests the paired accessor and mutator functions in Location.java. Half of the mutators take no parameters or only a Boolean value resulting in simple test cases. The other half take integer parameters. Equivalence class partitioning was performed for these functions and their corresponding accessor functions.

**Code coverage analysis**\
With the Eclipse IDE opened and the Battleship project imported, right-click on the top-level
Battleship project directory, select Coverage As, then select JUnit Test. Coverage results
will be displayed in the IDE's Coverage window.

## Usage

Here's a short explanation on how to use **Java-Battleship**:

* Use `java Battleship` on the command-line to run the code
* When the application starts, you, the player, sets up your board by typing in the on-screen coordinates.
* Then, the computer makes its own board and you play against it by guessing its ships' locations.
	* NOTE: The computer's board is printed on screen, just so the game can go faster.
* The program ends when one side beats the other.
